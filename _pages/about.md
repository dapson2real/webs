Welcome to my page. My first name is Adedapo, but prefers **Dapo**. I am an engineer/scientist looking for challenging opportunities in an industrial/academic environment. My keen interest in Data Science has revolved around data wrangling, machine learning, deep learning, and creating informative visualizations from complex datasets. I am always eager and interested in devising a better problem-solving method for challenging tasks, and learning new technologies and tools as the need arises. Recently, I have become more interested in applying open-source technologies to solving challenging tasks involving large, complex datasets, with the aim of utilizing different tools for collecting, organizing, cleaning, analyzing, and modeling data.

I have worked for more than 7 years in diverse roles ranging from doctoral research scientist for Computer Modelling Group Ltd, Calgary, reservoir engineer for Abu Dhabi National Oil Company – Onshore, and research engineer for Khalifa University, Abu Dhabi, U.A.E. I received my Ph.D. from the [University of Calgary - Schulich School of Engineering](http://schulich.ucalgary.ca/departments/chemical-and-petroleum-engineering/), Alberta, Canada, my MSc in Petroleum Engineering at [Khalifa University](http://www.ku.ac.ae/), U.A.E and my B.Tech in Chemical Engineering at [Ladoke Akintola University of Technology](http://www.lautech.edu.ng/), Nigeria.

At present, I have over 20 publications in refereed journals and conferences. I was one of the [11 recipients of the most prestigious *Vanier Canada Graduate Scholarship*](http://www.ucalgary.ca/utoday/issue/2014-08-15/eleven-vanier-scholarship-recipients-announced-2014) from University of Calgary in 2017. I have also been awarded one of the most prestigious scholarships - [*Killam Doctoral Memorial Scholarship*](https://www.ucalgary.ca/killam/doctoral/predoctoral) in 2017 and 2018. I also took the first position in [SPE Canada regional student paper contest](http://www.spe.org/students/contests/winners.php) and represented Canada at the international competition in 2017. My research interests are reservoir engineering and simulation, reservoir characterization, fluid transport in porous media, enhanced/improved Oil recovery, reactive transport modeling, geochemistry and geomechanics, analytical and numerical modeling, compositional simulation, pressure transient analysis, naturally fractured reservoirs, numerical optimization, data analytics/Machine Learning, Carbon sequestration and geothermal system.
